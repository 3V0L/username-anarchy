collect top 1000 names from forums

aim:
find some generic usernames that are popular across many forums.
generic means not unique, eg. slayer is generic, urbanadventurer is not.

hypothesis:

simple, generic usernames are registered earlier
names become more complex as the userbase grows
eg.

mike, dragon will appear in the top a
mike79, red_dragon/black_dragon will appear in the top b
mike_atlanta_79 and white_dragon_eyes will appear in the top c

where a, b and c are standard deviations (or whatever) apart.
